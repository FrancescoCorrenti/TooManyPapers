# MCP Tools Reference — Full Detail

## Paper tools (17)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `papers_list` | List all papers |
| `papers_get` | Get full paper card by ID |
| `papers_search` | Fuzzy search on title and authors (local catalog only) |
| `papers_by_concept` | Papers tagged with a concept |
| `papers_by_author` | Papers by author surname |
| `papers_by_venue` | Papers published in a venue |
| `papers_by_year` | Papers by publication year |
| `papers_outside` | Papers outside comfort zone |
| `papers_hidden` | Hidden papers |
| `papers_next_id` | Next available paper ID |
| `papers_discover` | Search arXiv/Semantic Scholar/OpenAlex for new papers (+ citation-based expansion), deduplicated across providers and against the catalog. The only sanctioned way to find new papers — never use WebSearch/WebFetch for this. |
| `papers_add` | Add a new paper (with validation) |
| `papers_update` | Update paper fields (merge patch) |
| `papers_check_duplicates` | Check candidates against existing catalog |
| `papers_hide` | Hide a paper from default views |
| `papers_unhide` | Restore a hidden paper |
| `papers_delete` | Permanently delete a paper (unlike `papers_hide`, the record is actually removed). Scrubs the deleted ID out of every other paper's `cites`/`cited_by`/`cites_unmatched` arrays. Cannot be undone — confirm with the user first. |

### `papers_discover` parameters

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `query` | string | Topic/keywords. Optional if `concept_id` or `seed_paper_ids` alone give enough context. |
| `concept_id` | string | Graph concept ID (e.g. `C003`) — its name/area/description are appended to the query. |
| `seed_paper_ids` | list of strings | Catalog paper IDs whose Semantic Scholar references are pulled in as extra candidates — this is the citation-search integration. |
| `providers` | list of strings | Subset of `arxiv`, `semantic_scholar`, `openalex` (default: all three). |
| `year_from` | int | Minimum publication year. |
| `max_results` | int | Per-provider cap before merge/dedup, 1-50 (default 10). |

Returns `new_candidates` (ready for `papers_add`), `already_in_catalog` (titles dropped as duplicates), and `errors` (per-provider failures — e.g. rate limits — reported plainly, never silently swallowed or papered over with invented data).
