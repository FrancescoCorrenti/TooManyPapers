# Too Many Papers

**An LLM-powered knowledge graph for the papers you'll never finish reading.**

A local-first research assistant for Claude. No cloud, no database, no subscriptions. Just JSON files and an MCP server that lets Claude read and write them through validated tools.

This repository is both the plugin source and a self-hosted **plugin marketplace**, so it installs in one command.

## Install

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

```
/plugin marketplace add FrancescoCorrenti/too-many-papers
/plugin install too-many-papers@too-many-papers
```

That's it. The MCP server, the skill (behavioral rules, onboarding, anti-hallucination protocol, morning briefing), and the Too Many Papers web UI are all installed together.

### Cowork

1. Open the **Customize** tab.
2. Go to **Plugins**.
3. Click **Add** (top right).
4. Choose **Add from repository** and paste the GitHub repo link as the marketplace: `https://github.com/FrancescoCorrenti/TooManyPapers`.
5. Sync, then add the **too-many-papers** plugin.

### Requirements

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — runs the MCP server. `uv` manages its own Python interpreter and installs dependencies on first run, so there's nothing to `pip install` and no dependency on whatever `python`/`python3` happens to be on your system PATH (this matters especially on Windows, and with conda — `uv` doesn't rely on an activated shell).
  - macOS/Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows (PowerShell): `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
- **Node.js 18+** — only needed if you want the Too Many Papers web UI. The MCP server and skill work without it.

## What is this?

It has two main interfaces:

1. **Your LLM chat**, where you discuss papers and the AI maintains a knowledge graph of your interests.
2. **Too Many Papers**, a local web app for browsing, searching, and managing your paper collection.

Once installed, run `/too-many-papers:webui` (or just ask the AI to "open Too Many Papers") — it calls the `webui_launch` MCP tool, which starts the server from the files already inside the installed plugin (no separate download, no need to locate the plugin folder yourself) and gives you the link: http://localhost:3737.

Features: full-text search, filter by concept/venue/read status, pin favorites to the top, citation network links (click to navigate), local PDF viewer, dark theme.

### The knowledge graph

Everything lives in a typed graph with **nodes** and **edges**:

| Node type | What it represents |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `concept` | A research area you care about |
| `project` | An active research project with goals |
| `endpoint` | A specific milestone within a project |
| `idea` | A concrete idea connected to a project |
| `pool` | A transversal idea that spans projects |

| Edge type | Connects |
|-----------|----------|
| `connected_to` | concept <> concept |
| `uses_concept` | project > concept |
| `part_of` | endpoint/idea > project |
| `inspired_by` | idea > paper |
| `relevant_to` | paper > project |
| `enables` | concept > concept (directional) |
| `derived_from` | any > any |

All types are **hardcoded and validated** by the MCP server. The LLM cannot invent new types.

### Engagement tracking

Every interaction with a concept is logged with a weight:

| Event | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| `read` | 2 |
| `discussed` | 3 |
| `deepened` | 5 |
| `linked` | 8 |
| `paper_requested` | 10 |

Scores decay at **0.7x per week**. The AI logs interactions automatically; no manual scoring needed.

### Anti-hallucination

- Every paper must have a `source_verified` URL from a primary source (arXiv, DOI, PubMed, etc.)
- Author lists must be complete and verbatim. "et al." is rejected.
- Connections between papers are marked `[inference]` when not fact-verified.
- The AI cannot invent node types, edge types, or interaction types.

## Morning Briefing

On first use, the AI offers a daily paper briefing: a curated selection of papers based on your engagement scores, active projects, and pending requests. If your client supports scheduled tasks, it sets one up with a fixed, hardcoded prompt (see the skill's `SKILL.md`) so the routine can't drift or hallucinate over time. Otherwise, just ask "give me today's paper briefing" any time.

### Why a marketplace, not just a plugin?

A bare plugin repo can still be installed directly (`/plugin install owner/repo`), but wrapping it in a marketplace gives you versioning, update notifications (`/plugin marketplace update`), and a clean install command that doesn't depend on knowing the exact plugin subpath.

## FAQ

**Do I need Claude specifically?**
The system is designed for Claude and tested with Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cowork. Any MCP-compatible client will work, but you'll need to load `skills/too-many-papers/SKILL.md` manually or adapt it to your client's conventions.

**Where is my data stored?**
Inside the installed plugin directory: `too-many-papers-plugin/server/_papers.json`, `_venues.json`, `_graph.json`. Plain JSON, version-controllable, portable.

**Can I use this without an LLM?**
Yes. `papers_api.py` works as a standalone CLI, and the Too Many Papers web UI works independently.

**How do I back up?**
It's just files. Copy `too-many-papers-plugin/server/` (inside your plugin install directory, typically under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/...`) or fork this repo and commit your own data.

**Can the AI modify my files directly?**
No. The skill instructs the AI to use MCP tools only. The tools validate everything: the AI cannot invent new node types, edge types, or bypass anti-hallucination checks.

**How do I update?**
Run `/plugin marketplace update` then `/plugin update too-many-papers@too-many-papers`.
